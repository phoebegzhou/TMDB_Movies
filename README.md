# TMDB_Movies_001
**Introduction:**

In this project, I analyzed the TMDb movie data set, which contains about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). This dataset contains different genres of movies, information about user ratings, and revenues. I explored the factors that impact revenues and their relationships with revenues.

**What do you need to install?**

Python and the following libraries:
1. pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. csv

I recommend installing Anaconda and IPython notebook. 

**Parts of project:** 

Data assessing includes using functions to look at the data. Data cleaning means using Python libraries to drop columns and duplicates, to deal with missing data, and to convert incorrect datatypes. Data Analyzing part using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the results.
